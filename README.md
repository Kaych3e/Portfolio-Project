## Setup
For the purpose of this project, the team shall be employing the use of Git flow for branching and merging. This will involve the team making changes in the pre-agreed branches and allowing for correction or review by the collaborators by creating a pull request for approval before merging onto the main or default branch. This is to prevent irreversible errors that can arise from pushing wrongly to the default branch. The branch would be deleted after merging to prevent team members from accidentally working on old branches.

The deployment strategy for this website would be Staged Deployment. This is also known as phased or incremental deployment. It involves rolling out the website updates in stages or phases. Instead of deploying changes to the entire user base at once, the updates are first deployed to a subset of users or specific environments, allowing for testing and validation. This strategy helps identify issues or bugs in a controlled environment before deploying to the entire user base. It provides a smoother transition and allows for easier rollback if any problems occur.

## Data Population
* Web Scraping: Web scraping involves extracting product information from other websites or online sources.
* API Integration: Product data would be gotten through APIs which would be integrated into the website to fetch and populate the data automatically. This approach allows for real-time or scheduled updates of product information, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date content.

## Testing Tools
* Apache JMeter: A performance testing tool that simulates user behavior and measures the performance of web applications under load.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
